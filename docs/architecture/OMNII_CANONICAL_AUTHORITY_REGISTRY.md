# OMNII Canonical Authority Registry

**Status:** Canonical technical control
**Purpose:** Prevent semantic regression by making architectural authority explicit and machine-checkable.

## Authority precedence

```text
CONSTITUTIONAL / FROZEN
    > CANONICAL ONTOLOGY / CONTRACT
    > EXPLICIT AMENDMENT
    > CAPABILITY / DOMAIN SPECIFICATION
    > IMPLEMENTATION
    > EXPERIMENT
    > CONVERSATION CHRONOLOGY
```

Chronology alone can never supersede a higher-authority record.

## Record model

Each canonical record contains:

- `canonical_id`
- `name`
- `status`
- `authority_level`
- `introduced_at`
- `canonical_source`
- `supersedes`
- `superseded_by`
- `aliases`
- `depends_on`
- `implements`
- `extends`
- `branch`

## Status values

- `FROZEN`
- `CANONICAL`
- `AMENDMENT`
- `CAPABILITY`
- `DOMAIN`
- `IMPLEMENTATION`
- `EXPERIMENTAL`
- `DEPRECATED`
- `HISTORICAL`

## Enforcement rules

1. A lower-authority artifact cannot redefine a higher-authority identifier or boundary.
2. A rename keeps the canonical identifier and records the new name as an alias or successor.
3. A merge preserves lineage from each prior concept into the canonical destination.
4. A frozen change requires an explicit architecture-amendment record.
5. A capability or branch may extend a canonical contract but cannot silently create a competing universal primitive.
6. Unknown concepts may be registered provisionally without inferred authority.
7. Historical material remains traceable and cannot silently become current authority.

## Initial protected concepts

The following existing frozen concepts are protected by this registry: Carbon Actual, Omni, Being, ABBA, Value, Pulse, IO, Union, Communication, Continuum, Governance, Mathematics, Integration, HASH, SEAL, HAPI, HAPI World, Terminal, Mint, Root, Index, Vault, Actual, Atlas, Becoming, Ash, Phoenix, the ten architectural families, the universal object model, logical ledgers, tokenization/fractionalization/decimalization/democratization/decentralization, and the product-composition rule.

## Relationship to implementation

The registry governs architecture only. It does not freeze providers, databases, model vendors, SDKs, infrastructure, pricing, exact economic formulas or product UI.
